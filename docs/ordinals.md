# Ordinals in API system

The Babylon Staking API allows for the option to deploy additional endpoints  
that check whether a UTXO contains an inscription or not, with the aim to help  
staking applications identify whether they should avoid spending a particular UTXO.  
This is accomplished through a connection to the  
[Ordinal Service](https://github.com/ordinals/ord) and  
a connection to the Unisat API.  
Due to Unisat being a payed service and applying rate limits,  
the API initially tries to get the status of a UTXO through the Ordinals Service,  
and if that fails, then contacts the Unisat API,  
effectively using it as a back-up mechanism to handle downtime from the Ordinals Service.  

NOTE: To enable the optional ordinal API endpoint, you will need to provide the 
`ordinal` and `unisat` configurations under `assets`

## Ordinal service Client

The Ordinal Service Client is the primary method for checking inscriptions on UTXOs. It connects directly to a running instance of the [Ordinal Service](https://github.com/ordinals/ord).

### Verification Process

1. The `verifyViaOrdinalService` function is called with a list of UTXOs.
2. It uses the `FetchUTXOInfos` method of the Ordinals client to get information about the UTXOs.
3. For each UTXO, it checks:
   - If the `Runes` field is not empty and not "{}"
   - If the `Inscriptions` field is not empty
4. If either condition is true, the UTXO is marked as having an inscription.



## Unisat Service Client

You can find more information about Unisat's Ordinal/BRC-20/Runes related endpoints at:
https://docs.unisat.io/

In our service, we only utilize the following endpoint:
- `/v1/indexer/address/{{address}}/inscription-utxo-data`

### How to Use It

1. Log in via https://developer.unisat.io/account/login (create an account if you don't have one).
2. Copy the `API-Key`.
3. Set the key as an environment variable named `UNISAT_TOKEN`.
4. Configure the values for `unisat.host`, `limit`, `timeout`, etc. Refer to `config-docker.yml`.
5. Ensure you also set up the `ordinals` configuration, as this is a dependency.
6. Call the POST endpoint `/v1/ordinals/verify-utxos` as shown in the example below:
7. The calls to unisat will only be triggered if the ordinal service is not responding or returning errors
